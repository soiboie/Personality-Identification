## Description
This web application allows users to take a personality test based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) framework, which identifies one of 16 personality types based on four dichotomies: Extraversion (E) or Introversion (I), Sensing (S) or Intuition (N), Thinking (T) or Feeling (F), and Judging (J) or Perceiving (P). Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHPMyAdmin for backend database management, the application provides an interactive experience where users answer questions and receive a detailed description of their personality type.

## Features
- **Welcome Page**: Introduces the personality test with questions organized into four sections corresponding to MBTI dichotomies.
- **Question Sections**: Covers Introvert/Extrovert, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving.
- **Results Page**: Displays the user’s personality type with a tailored description.
- **Customized Design**: Separate HTML and CSS files for each of the 16 personality types.
- **JavaScript Logic**: Calculates and predicts personality types based on user responses.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enhanced webpage design for an intuitive experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHPMyAdmin (for database management)
