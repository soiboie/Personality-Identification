Included Results page for the Test as well but it is still under development with side.js file. 


Third Commit ( 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM) : The Javascript manages the middle-end to calculate and predict the personality type with each characteristics from the 4 sections into one of the 16 types to finally see the results. The results for the test will go to one of the 16 types which are handled by seperate html and css files for each personality.

Fourth Commit ( 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM): Brushed Up the initial webpage design with better ones and fully implemented Results pages for all personality types. The Hosting can be by using Xampp Control Panel with Apache and MySQL running. 

Installation Steps:
Step 1: Start off by Installing Xampp application and open its control panel
Step 2: Install all the files given in the repository and store under a single folder and preferably in xampp > htdocs 
Step 3: To run the files accordingly , there are two steps:
          the file paths should be directed properly and modify accordingly in the code files 
          In xampp control panel start running apache and mysql 

Step 4: after all these steps , Open web browser and type in "localhost\" and the file path in which you have stored index.html 
        Now the application can show you the results for your own Personality Test.
